# xcodeproj_min_version

How to reproduce:

`bazel run //:BazelSampleXcodeProj`

Problems:
* I have a module, in this module I have two classes, a View in swift that is not public, which only works within the module, and a ViewController in objc. When I have to use the View in swift in objc, it does not find the View, only if I declare this view as public, but it is not public, it is only internal to the module. I do not know if this is a problem or if it is expected, in what was used in rules_apple it also gave this problem
    * To Reproduce: Remove public of `LabelView` in `Modules/ObjcModule/Sources/Views/LabelView.swift`
* When I go to import -Swift it is not found if I put it with `<ObjcModule/ObjcModule-Swift.h>`, it only works if I put its full path, like `#import Modules/ObjcModule/ObjcModule-swift.h`.
* Another point is that I can't use it via the command line, when I do a build bazel ... it ends up giving the problem below (I believe it's because of XCFramework: Note: This doesn't happen if I'm running it with the Xcode generated by rules_xcodeproj. Note: It was also an error that occurred in the rules_apple rule
